1. Does Java support multiple inheritance?
    - Java does NOT support multiple inheritance with classes.
      You cannot extend more than one class at the same time.
    - Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
      A class can implement multiple interfaces.

2. Why no multiple inheritance with classes?
    - To avoid ambiguity problems (like the Diamond Problem)
      when two parent classes have methods with the same signature.
    - It keeps the language simpler and avoids conflicts.

-> Multiple class inheritance-❌Not allowed
-> Multiple interface inheritance-✅Allowed
-> Interface + single class inheritance-✅Allowed
