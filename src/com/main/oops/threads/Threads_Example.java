/*
A thread in Java is a lightweight unit of a process.
It allows a program to do multiple tasks at the same time
(i.e., multitasking or parallel execution).

Threads are used to:
    -> Perform multiple tasks simultaneously (multithreading).
    -> Improve performance.
    -> Make applications more responsive

Two Ways to Create a Thread:
    1. Extending Thread class
    2. Implementing Runnable interface
