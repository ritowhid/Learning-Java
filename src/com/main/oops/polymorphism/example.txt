    -> Polymorphism:
    -> Poly means- many,
    -> Morphism means- behaviour
    -> Which means there is something which behaves differently in different situation.
    -> We have different name on different places, at home you named one,
       at office you are boss or employee, at class you are student.
       your name changes at every places and your behavior also changes based on the places.
    -> In the world of object oriented we have a concept of many behavior polymorphism
       so the same object or same reference will have different behavior based on how you
       create the instance of it.

    -> There are 2 types of Polymorphism:
       i. Compile time polymorphism (also called early binding)
            - Behavior defined at compile time
            - Overloading: where you decide based on the parameters at compile time itself
       ii. Run time polymorphism (also called late binding)
            - If the behavior will be defined at run time that is called a runtime polymorphism
            - Overriding: You are not sure which method will be called

    -> When you compile the file and when you know what things
       will be get executed at the compile time itself, it is compile time.

    -> Which method will be executed will be decided at runtime, that's run time.
