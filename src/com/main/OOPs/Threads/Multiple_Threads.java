/* of course, you can't run all threads at the same time, so they go for time-sharing.
   so 'scheduler': is responsible, basically allows a thread to execute.
   we have multiple threads to execute. let's say we have 8 threads here, and we only have 2 cores available
   in my cpu. So 'scheduler' knows you can actually run only 2 threads at the same time. Basically it's allow this
   thread and this thread to execute. after this, next thread and next thread to execute.
   So basically we are running multiple threads at the same time.
