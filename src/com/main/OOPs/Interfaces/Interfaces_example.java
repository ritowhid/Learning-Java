An Interface in Java is defined as an abstract
type used to specify the behavior of a class.
An interface in Java is a blueprint of behavior.
A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.

// So we don't need to define like this -> public abstract void show();

    //interfaces will tell what method you need but will not implement them

    // if you fail to define both the method, by default, your class also becomes abstract,

    // in that case my job is to define both the methods show(),config().

        System.out.println(A.area); // directly used here
        /*
            Why it is static final ?!
            -> at first I don't instantiate the interface, I instantiate the class.
               And I'm doing 'implements', not extends.
            -> In implements I get only method, I don't get variables there.
            -> That's why it is static because we want to use the interface name
            -> And 'final' - interface object or interface don't have their own memory in the heap
               there create the object of B, not A. So if you don't have your own memory, how can
               you have a non-final variable.
