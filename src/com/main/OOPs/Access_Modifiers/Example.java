package com.main.OOPs.Access_Modifiers;
/* In Java, access modifiers are used to set the accessibility (visibility) of classes,
interfaces, variables, methods, constructors, data members, and the setter methods.

Note the keyword public and private. These are access modifiers in Java.
They are also known as visibility modifiers.

Note: You cannot set the access modifier of getters methods.

/*
    - In one file you should have only one class.
    - Try to make your class public
    - Try to make your instance variables private
    - The method most of the time will be public
    - But if you think there is a method or a variable
      which should be accessed only in the subclass of other packages,
      use protected.
    - Try to avoid default. It should not be using.
    - Try to use protected or public
