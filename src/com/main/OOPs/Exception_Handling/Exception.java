/* Error different types:
    1. Compile time error.

    2. Runtime error -> is an error that occurs while a
       program is running, after it has been successfully compiled.

       Or you're using an application, and accidentally you delete a file
       of this application that needs to use the application, that time
       application will not work.

       Or you're playing a game and winning a big money, that time game
       is crashed.

       Or medical software, or plane software stop working during work,
       that's a problem, we will face this problem, but we have to handle this
       problem/ this runtime error, it should not stop your application.

       This runtime error we call 'Exception', basically we need to handle
       the exceptions.

    3. Logical error.

    - If you give 'P' capital letter in println(),
    it's called syntactical error.
    & also compile time error.
