        -> File handling, while often used within object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms,
        is not inherently part of OOP. File handling is a fundamental programming concept that
        involves operations like creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files, and
        can be implemented in various programming styles, including procedural, functional,
        and object-oriented.

        -> Elaboration:
        OOP and File Handling:
        In OOP, file handling can be encapsulated within classes and objects, promoting code
        organization and reusability. For example, you might have a FileHandler class that
        manages file operations, with methods for opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
        This aligns with OOP principles like encapsulation (bundling data and methods) and
        abstraction (hiding complex implementation details).

        Beyond OOP:
        However, file handling can also be implemented without relying on OOP. In languages like C,
        file operations are typically performed using functions and structures, without the need for
        classes or objects. Procedural programming approaches can effectively handle file operations.
        Examples:
        In Python, file handling is often done using the open() function and file objects. While
        you can create classes to manage file operations, it's not mandatory.
        In C++, file handling relies on classes like ifstream, ofstream, and fstream,
        which are part of the standard library. These classes provide a way to interact with files,
        and their methods can be used within an OOP context.

        In summary: File handling is a broader concept than OOP, and it can be implemented both with
        and without object-oriented principles. While OOP can enhance the structure and organization
        of file operations, it's not a prerequisite for file handling itself.
